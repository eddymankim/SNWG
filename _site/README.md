### Course Description
This course explores experimental applications of web graphics technology in the service of communicating spatial narratives.
The spatial narratives will strive to reimagine the concept of space and the practice of storytelling in the context of browser-based graphics environments.
This course will contemplate specifically the use of multi-dimensional media via the web as a vehicle for delivering spatial narratives.
Web graphics technologies, such as CSS, SVG, Canvas and WebGL, have dramatically increased in their compatibility with both mobile and desktop computing devices and have consequently broadened the reach of graphically rich content to the masses.
Students will work on a semester-long project in the form of an interactive web application that challenges, augments, or reaffirms the sense of space through deliberate use of storytelling devices.
Upon culmination, the projects will be exhibited on the course website for public viewing.
The first half of the course will consist of workshops for building various skills from asset creation to graphics programming.
Starting with a brief introduction to HTML/CSS/JS and UI/UX design principles, the workshops will focus primarily on the THREE.js library.
The second half of the course will focus on the production of the final project where class times will turn into hack sessions.
While there is no prerequisite for this course, some familiarity of the technologies mentioned above and basic programming skills are highly preferred.
First class will meet after Labor Day on September 6, 2017.

**_In short, this course is a research seminar that will explore affordances of spatial narratives by experimenting with various web graphics technologies._**

### Learning Objectives
Students will produce an interactive 3D narrative experience for the web,
and will gain technical, conceptual, and organizational insights along the way.

### Outcomes
By the end of the course, students should have the following outcomes:
- Gain experience in programming web-based interactive 3D applications
- Gain experience in conceptualizing, constructing, and delivering spatial narratives
- Gain theoretical insights into the potential applications for spatial communication using web graphics technologies

From a technical perspective, the students can hope to learn how to: 
- Work on web-based multimedia projects, organizing work and assets
- Model evocative environments and models in CAD softwares (3DS Max, Rhino)
- Create simple animations and write simple interactive scripts
- Leverage audio, video, images, and prose in 3D experiences

### Evaluation Criteria
Experimentation is encouraged in this course. The experiments shall strive to challenge, accentuate, and intertwine the following spatial concepts:
- Dimensionality
- Materiality
- Scale
