Following on last week’s walker definition, I tried to implement raycasting on the randomly generated line I've created. The challenges I’ve put myself this week were implementing a raycasting vector, creating an intersection point, creating a ‘cursor’ object that points the intersection, implement keyboard commands and finally add or remove objects using inputs. Even though some of the challenges are buggy, this was a great experimentation for me that made javascript a little bit more lovable for me. Currently, I have a buggy raycasting vector which is little bit off from the actual cursor and for some reason I could not figure out why, the intersection point starts to move towards the camera. Nevertheless I am happy that I was able to implement somewhat working raycasting.
