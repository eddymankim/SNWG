This is a quick sketch utilizing point attractor deformation on a sphere.

My experience uploading the 3D sketch to Sketchfab was mostly flawless. I mostly had some problems with Grasshopper plugin for Sketchfab, but once everything was set on Grasshopper side, rest went through easily.

Settings on Sketchfab UI was fairly similar to a basic render programs such as KeyShot. My previous experience with 3D model repositories go as far as GrabCAD and Thingiverse, in which render options are limited or mostly not accessible by the uploader/user.
