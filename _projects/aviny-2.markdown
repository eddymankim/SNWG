Reflections & motives 

Sketchfab is pretty cool.  I think the real time rendering is amazing and I love that you can add lighting and textures easily within the website.  That said... I couldn't figure out how to get my textures to map correctly so that will require a little more digging.

As far as my motives for taking this course go... I'm working as a designer at a tech company that primarily engages with our users via the web.  I'm interested in developing a better understanding of the kind of experiences and interactions that are possible with web technologies.
