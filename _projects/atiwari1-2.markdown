Here is a 3D model I whipped up using signed distance functions + raymarching, using Reza Ali's [F3](http://www.syedrezaali.com/f3-mac-app/) to turn it into a mesh.

Publishing the 3D model to sketchfab was relatively painless, and I was surprised at the amount of rendering options available. It would be cool if there was a way to also write a shader to be run on the model. Probably the hardest part was finding the `3D Settings` button as sketchfab was defaulting to a mobile layout (as I had my screen split).

I want to take this course to develop weird 3D experiences online, from 3D net-art like stuff to strange ways of modelling matter and experiencing information. I also like maps, and I want to mess with the WebGL based mapping toolkits and the like. I also like ML, so I want to mash that all together in a place where people can experience it — online!
