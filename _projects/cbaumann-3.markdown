My research for this assignment was guided first by my curiosity in the graphic capabilities of Three.js, and then how artists and developers have explored user interaction.

In "Mr.Doob's" piece above, I was interested in the sense of depth that can be created despite the limitations of the screen. While this piece explores the challenges of creating this experience more from a technical perspective, I believe that it is also an design challenge as the designer had to confront issues of legibility.

In his other piece, Mr.Doob explores how one can navigate and interactice with an immersive experience. In this course, I am interested in creating a prototype for my graduate work that explores how users interact with virtual surroundings. While Mr.Doob limited the scope of his interactions to those similar to a video game, I am curious on exploring new means of interacting and manipulating online experiences.

I focused more on how designers brought narrative and open online interaction together. In the case of "Chaos To Perfection", I was interested in how the designers grounded the experience in a somewhat familiar setting as I would like to learn more about how designers are bridging the gap between the physical and digital world.

In "Nouvelle Vague", the designers tackled the question of virtual community and interactive experiences by creating an environmnet that responds to tweets filtered by the user. While the project does not offer direct interaction with others, it is an interesting approach to how virutal environments curate your interactions between yourself and others.
