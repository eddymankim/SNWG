For my first exploration into publishing 3D models online, I used a model I made during my first semester as a graduate student. My partner, Atefeh Madavi, and I used motion tracking to track the movement of a participant erasing marks on a white board. The model was originally in Rhino 3D, and the data, collected a total of nine times, are represented as different colored as curves. The Rhino model also includes a model of a classroom for reference and scale.

I began my process by using the built-in export options. When I first exported the model under an “.obj” format onto Sketchfab (which I used to test the visualization of my model), I noticed a few discrepancies between my Rhino 3D model and the model on Sketchfab. First, several elements of my model were not represented in the online 3D model. The classroom, the white board, and the data curves themselves were not transferred over even though they were included in my selection when I exported the model. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the default lighting and color settings used by Sketchfab.

As shown above, only the elements in my model that were mesh objects had been appropriately exported. I realized that I could not simply export my model as it was, instead requiring some manipulation in Rhino.  My first edits were that I tried to create pipe objects around the data curves. To try and maintain legibility in my model, I only created three pipes around a curve that represented a variety in form and data tracking. I also created surfaces around the classroom. This model’s export was much more successful in that the classroom was visible, as well as the pipes I had built around my data curves. However, I noticed that the pipes had not maintained their independence from one another. Instead they had merged into a single object. Also, the model had been rotated so that when I first opened the model, it was at a right angle compared to my original model. My main observation during this process was in the struggle to maintain legibility between my original model and the online version. I lost a lot of information when I exported my model and will have to consider that for future projects.

My motivations for taking this course are to help create a vital portion of my graduate work while benefitting from the perspective and guidance of my peers. I am interested in creating an interactive, 3D experience that can be accessed online and played. I would then like to set up the experience so that I can collect data on user interaction. I am also interested in learning more about Javascript, CSS, and programming for web graphics. On this front, my interests lay in examining the methodology behind creating a visually pleasing online experience, as well as the considerations that a designer must have in mind when they are formulating a design intended for communication via the web. I would like to tackle the question of representing 3D designs through the constraints of a two-dimensional space, and how three-dimensional forms can be informed by their two-dimensional constraints. In summation, I would like to create a data driven spatial experience that also responds to user input, and in doing so acquire familiarity with advanced technologies through a design studio setting.
