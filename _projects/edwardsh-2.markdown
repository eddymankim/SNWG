Sketchfab Analysis

When first publishing my 3D model, I notice how detailed and considerate the application is. The upload page first notes two kinds of 3D models and the compatible files types that can be read. Afterwards, when inputting the description, categories, and tags, there is a bar that indicates how easily users can find your project, which made me feel more critical about how detailed I should describe my model. All the while, it was easy to follow, and I am delighted to see an array of social sites that I can show my work to expand my audience even further.



Motivations

As an architecture student, I am deeply interested in the space we create and how perceive its intentions and moods embedded into the whole environment. I had some experience writing stories and narratives as a hobby and learned how to express emotion and create images with words. Now, because of my strong interest in computers and its generated graphics, I want to learn how I can communicate to people using shapes and space and how they greatly differ from the literate methods.
