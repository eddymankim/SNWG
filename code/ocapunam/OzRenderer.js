/// 2017-10-11 Your Name @your-andrew-id
///
/// your encapsulation of my typical render setup
///

///
/// In this workshop you will get to create your own customized renderer.
/// You'll be "encapsulating" the stuff you usually use to render the scene,
/// so that you can reuse it and spend your time actually doing fun things.
///
/// Begin by copying the contents of this folder (`workshop-1`)
/// into your named folder in `code/`, and then renaming `your-name-workshop-1.md`
/// to something more appropriate, and then putting it in `_projects` as usual.
///
/// In some places you'll see "mystery comments": `/* ??? */`
///
/// These indicate that you'll have to fill something in or write something.
/// You may have to write a whole bunch of things in one mystery comment,
/// it's not like filling out a form, you'll have to work some things out.
///
///
/// In other places, you might see `null` or `Null` instead of a real value.
///
/// Nothing (in this file, at least) is supposed to have a value of `null`,
/// and nothing is supposed to be named `Null`, so if you see null,
/// that's your cue to replace it with something sensible.
///
///
/// If something is too difficult for you at the moment, that's OK.
/// A working example can be found here: `code/workshop-1/SimpleRenderer.js`.
/// If you're bored to death, take a look at `code/evan-erdos/FancyRenderer.js`.
///
///


///
/// (1) Figure out how to `import` code resources from other files:
///
///     1a. Find the module file in the lib directory and add its
///         relative path to the import statement to load from it.
///
///     1b. Figure out how to import everything from it:
///         there are specific syntaxes for importing things selectively,
///         but in this case you'll want to import everything at once.
///
 import * as THREE from '../lib/module.js'


///
/// (2) Name your `class` and `export` it to other scripts:
///
///     2a. Pick a name for your "thing which renders scenes with atmosphere".
///
///     2b. While there are ways to `export` many things,
///         you just want to `export` this specific class *automatically*.
///
export default class ozRenderer {


    ///
    /// (3) Write your `constructor` so that it can flexibly take in data:
    ///
    ///     3a. You're going to want to have good defaults for missing info:
    ///
    ///     3b. Instead of trying to keep track of hundreds of variables,
    ///         let's destructure the incoming argument and find them by name.
    ///
    ///     3c. Some constructors expect their input to be an `object`,
    ///         namely the `THREE.Material` constructor, and we can do the same.
    ///
    ///     3d. We could just have one object and see if it has certain data,
    ///         or we could use an ES6 trick called "pattern matching".
    ///
    ///     3e. First we assign the empty object `{}` into our argument,
    ///         and then we use destructuring to extract certain variables.
    ///
    ///     3f. Elsewhere, destructuring might look something like this:
    ///         `let { date, name, time } = someObject`.
    ///
    ///     3g. Use the same syntax inside the constructor arguments,
    ///         and notice how, just like regular functions,
    ///         you don't need to write `var` before each argument.
    ///
    ///     3h. Once your constructor is set up to destructure,
    ///         then you can *add* defaults to the destructured variables,
    ///         which would look like the below example (if it were a declaration):
    ///         `let { date, name='Jeff' } = someObject`.
    ///
    ///     3i. If you get stuck you can look at `evan-erdos/SimpleRenderer.js`,
    ///         you don't have to completely understand how it works to use it.
